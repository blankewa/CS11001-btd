                    Bloons Tower Defense is the first game in the BTD series, released on August 16, 2007, as a free flash browser game. 
                    In this first entry, players must defend against waves of different bloons with a small roster of towers which the player can position around the map. 
                    Bloons have a varying amount of layers, with each layer being pierced revealing the layer underneath until the bloon has been completely popped. 
                    If all 40 lives are lost, the game is over. If all 50 waves are passed, the player will win the game. 
                    The game has 5 towers, the Dart Tower, Tack Tower, Ice Tower, Bomb Tower, and Super Monkey, which all appear in future Bloons Tower Defense games with minor name changes.

                        Bloons TD 4 later received a standalone "expansion pack" called Bloons TD 4 Expansion which added the Dartling Gun and Spike Factory towers, 
                        both of which would remain in future games, 4 new tracks, a new game mode called "Deflation", and a new "Tower Specialties" game mechanic.

                        Bloons TD 5 Deluxe was released on January 27, 2012, for USD$19.99 during the promotional pre-order period. 
                        This offline Flash version of the game added 2 new towers (the "Bloonchipper" and "Monkey Engineer"), 6 new tracks, 
                        4 ported tracks from Bloons TD 4, a "moving tower platform" mechanic, three new "Special Agent" towers and four additional 
                        "Special Missions". All of the game's premium features, which were paid for with the "NinjaKiwi Coin" digital currency in BTD5, 
                        were also made into free unlockable options that could be unlocked with the in-game earnable currency. This version of the game also has high-resolution graphics. 
                        An update for the mobile version of BTD5 added a new tower called the "Monkey Sub". The submarine was later added to the online version on July 22, 2015. 
                        Bloons TD 5 Deluxe was discontinued and made no longer available for purchase in November 2014 in favour of the newer Steam port, 
                        which all owners of Deluxe received for free through e-mail.

                        As with previous games of the series, the player has to protect the exit(s) against enemy Bloons by using various monkeys and monkey-operated 
                        machines placed in strategic locations to fight them off effectively. Compared to earlier versions of the series, there is a wider variety of different towers and their upgrades.

                        Speed and health ramping also buff the blimp hp throughout the rounds. The Steam/Mobile version has two special mode bosses, the Dreadbloon and Blastapopoulos.

                        Bloons TD 6 is the sixth game in the main Bloons TD series. After being announced on March 28, 2017, 
                        it was released for the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store on June 14, 2018. A Steam version was released on December 17, 2018. 
                        Unlike all earlier games, Bloons TD 6 does not have a Flash-based counterpart on the Ninja Kiwi website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Bloons TD 6, it is played from a 2.5D perspective, as opposed to the 2D perspective of previous Bloons 
                        Tower Defense games, and utilizes 3D computer graphics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bloons TD 6 expands on traditional Bloons Tower Defense gameplay with "Heroes", who will progressively level up once placed, 
                        making them stronger as the game progresses 3 "Tier 5" Monkeys of the same type can be merged with money and other copies of the monkey into extremely 
                        expensive but extremely powerful versions of themselves called "Paragons", combining the power of its constituent monkeys into a single strong monkey. 
                        Certain maps contain obstacles that can prevent many monkeys from seeing or attacking over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maps are chosen at the discretion of the player, and more difficult ones are unlocked by completing games on easier maps that you have not completed before. 
                        As the player completes games on the same map by playing on different game difficulties, additional game modes become unlocked for that map. In standard gameplay, 
                        each map can be played on three different game difficulties. On top of the standard game mode, Bloons TD 6 offers multiple additional game modes that use certain 
                        rules and restrictions, such as limiting what monkeys the player can use or making Bloons stronger in some aspects. Players can create games featuring rules not present 
                        in ordinary games, for example, they may limit the number of monkeys that may be used. These can be created using the "Challenge Editor", and these can be played by 
                        other players using the "Challenge Browser".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Daily and weekly events can be optionally played, rewarding currency when completed. Daily Challenges and Advanced Challenges are challenges that have a set of special rules added. 
                        "Race Events", where "rounds" of Bloons can be sent early to obtain the fastest time possible, "Odyssey Mode", where a limited selection of monkeys must be used to complete 
                        several maps in a row, and "Boss Bloons", where "Boss Bloons" must be destroyed, with different Boss Bloons being able to affect gameplay in different ways. 
                        A mini-game called "Contested Territory" is a weekly event that sets up to 90 players in six random teams from around the world to fight for various tiles scattered across a hexagonal 
                        island; each tile contains a unique set of rules, which the player must follow and complete in order to capture the tile. In update 39.0, the Map Editor was added, allowing 
                        players to make their own maps with props, effects, pets, up to 5 paths, a base floor, and areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, towers from Bloons TD 5 were added, first being the "Mortar Monkey" in update 6.0, then the "Engineer Monkey" in update 12.0, and then finally the "Dartling Gun", 
                        renamed to "Dartling Gunner" in update 22.0. In update 36.0, a new tower—the Beast Handler—was added, which controls water, ground and air beasts, which can merge with other Beast 
                        Handlers' beasts to increase their power. In 44.0, another brand-new amphibious tower—the Mermonkey—was implemented, which has various ocean-themed upgrades.
